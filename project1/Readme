This is a Python script that displays the current  date, time, hostname, and approximate location of the person running the script. This script uses geocoder to display the location of the user's device. To run this command you can either run .\dateTimeLocation.py or python dateTimeLocation.py. If you encounter any problems with the location you may need to install geocoded.
