Project 2: This Python script is a continuation of Project 1. It displays the current date, time, hostname, weather, and the approximate location of the person running the script as a pop-up.

Requirements: Please install geocoder, tkinter, OpenWeatherMap, and ensure requests are installed as well.

Code:

pip install geocoder
pip install tk
pip install OpenWeatherMap
pip install requests

Navigate to openweathermap.org, create an account, and once signed up, go to your account settings to copy your API code. Open the Project 2 script and paste your API code as follows:

API_KEY = 'PlaceAPI_InHere'
Run the command to ensure it works: open the command line, navigate to the file location, and run .\Project2. It will display the information as a pop-up.

To set it up to run automatically upon login(optional):

Open Task Scheduler.
Create a new task.
Set the trigger to "At log on."
Set the action to start a program and select the Python interpreter with the path to your script as the argument.
